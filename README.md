🚀 **TensorFlow Image Classification**

This project builds an **image classification model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras**. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains **handwritten digits (0-9)**. The goal is to recognize and classify these digits accurately.

## 🔍 Dataset: MNIST
MNIST is a dataset containing **10 classes** of images:
- The digits **0 to 9**
- Each image has a **size of 28x28 pixels** in **grayscale** (single color channel).
